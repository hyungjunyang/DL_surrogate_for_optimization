# Deep learning based Surrogate for optimization
These codes are used to construct the deep learning based surrogate models for fast and accurate optimization. 

The codes in 1.1 - 1.3 optimize discrete variables, locations of wells for fluid production, using CNN-based surrogate models.

The codes in 2.2 - 2.3 optimize time dependent continuous variables, operation conditions, using LSTM-based surrogate models. 

The details of CNN-based surrogate model can be found in my co-authored paper: Kim, J., Yang, H., & Choe, J. (2020). Robust optimization of the locations and types of multiple wells using CNN based proxy models. Journal of Petroleum Science and Engineering, 107424.
